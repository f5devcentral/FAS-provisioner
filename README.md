# F5 SANDBOX PROVISIONER

## Overview
The F5 Sandbox Provisioner is a part of the Solution Sandbox. This is a scenario based demo environment to help users learn about how F5 delivers Application Services to improve security and performance

## Goal
With F5 Sandbox Provisioner, users are provided with an **F5 + Ansible** sandbox environment fully configured in the cloud. The Sandbox Provisioner deploys the infrastructure for the Solution Sandbox  in AWS. This consists of:
- A F5 BIG-IP Virtual Edition instance
- Two webservers
- An Ansible node 

The Solution Sandbox can be used:
- to build demos and proof of concepts
- to find automation solutions for common customer use-cases
- as a self learning tool to get familiar with Ansible Automation for F5


## How to use?
Follow [F5 Ansible AWS Provisioner](https://github.com/f5devcentral/F5-Automation-Sandbox) for detailed steps to spin up and tear down the sandbox infrastructure using the Sandbox Provisioner
